   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <h3>For the Cupcakes</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two 12-cup muffin pans with cupcake liners.</li>
       <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
       <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy.</li>
       <li>Add the sugar and beat until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated before adding the next. Stop and scrape down the bowl between each egg.</li>
       <li>Beat in the vanilla extract.</li>
       <li>Stir together the sour cream and whole milk in a measuring cup or medium mixing bowl.</li>
       <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add a third of the flour mixture to the butter mixture followed by half of the sour cream mixture. Repeat, alternating between the flour and sour cream. Scrape down the bowl.</li>
       <li>Beat in the chopped strawberries and food coloring (if using).</li>
       <li>Divide the batter among the cupcake liners (about ¼ cup per liner).</li>
       <li>Bake one pan at a time for 20 to 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
       <li>Let cool for a few minutes in the pan, then remove the cupcakes and continue cooling on a wire rack.</li>
   </ol>
   <h3>For the Strawberry Buttercream</h3>
   <ol>
       <li>In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until very creamy and pale, about 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add in the powdered sugar and strawberry puree until fully combined. Stop and scrape down the bowl as needed.</li>
       <li>Add the vanilla extract.</li>
       <li>Increase speed to medium and beat until fluffy and very spreadable, about 1 minute.</li>
       <li>Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a decorative tip and pipe the frosting on top of the cooled cupcakes.</li>
       <li>Garnish with fresh strawberries, if desired.</li>
       <li>Cupcakes can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature without the garnish for up to 3 days or refrigerated for up to 1 week.</li>
